	* src/rifiuti.c:
	- Add -o option to specify output file name.
	- Use file stream throughout the whole file, drop usage of file
	descriptor.
	- Change fprintf into fputs or g_fprintf when the most appropriate
	one fits.

	* src/rifiuti.c:
	- Cope with the case when deleted file is from a network
	share (thus first char is backslash).
	- Defines _GNU_SOURCE to avoid warning when compiling under Linux.
	- Replace g_strdup_printf with g_snprintf to avoid copying exceedingly
	large string.
	- Warn if end of file is not a proper footer (exactly 4 bytes).
