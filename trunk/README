==== What is rifiuti2? ====

rifiuti2 is a rewrite of rifiuti, a great tool from Foundstone folks
for analyzing Windows Recycle Bin INFO2 file. But since rifiuti
(last updated 2004) is restricted to English version of Windows
(fail to analyze any non-latin character), thus this rewrite.


==== Features ====

* Support Windows in any other languages
* Support Vista and 2008 (no more uses INFO2 file)
* Enables localization (translatable) using glib
* More rigorous error checking
* Supports output in XML format

Newest features can be found in NEWS file.


==== Compiling ====

====== Requirement for Linux ======

* Basic development toolchain (autoconf, automake, make, binutils, gcc...)
* glib >= 2.6 (can be obtained from most Linux distributions).

====== Requirement for Windows ======

* Basic MinGW installation plus MSYS (please refer to www.mingw.org on
  how to set up)
* GTK+ runtime AND development packages from glade-win32 project
  (http://gladewin32.sourceforge.net/).
  _NEVER EVER_ use the one available from MinGW download repository,
  that one is broken regarding display of non-english character.
  The one from gimp-w32 can't be used as well since it only
  contains runtime.

Similar to all programs using autotools, it can be compiled quickly with
this command:

    ./configure && make

Please refer to 'INSTALL' document on how to specify options for
configure script.


==== Supported platform ====

So far it has been tested on Linux (Ubuntu feisty), Windows 2000 and XP.
More compatibility fix for other architectures welcome.
