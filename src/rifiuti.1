.SH DESCRIPTION
Rifiuti2 analyse recycle bin files from Windows. Analysis of
Windows recycle bin is usually carried out during Windows computer
forensics. Rifiuti2 can extract file deletion time, original
path and size of deleted files and whether the deleted files have
been moved out from the recycle bin since they are trashed.
.PP
Rifiuti2 supports a wide range of Windows versions, from Windows 95 to
Windows 10. The command used for analysis depends on the version
of Windows producing the recycle bin (\fBnot the version of users'
system!\fP), which uses vastly different format before and after Vista:
.PP

.TP
\fCrifiuti-vista\fP
For Vista or later, which is located in
.nh
\fC\\$Recycle.bin\\\fP\fI<SID>\fP\fC\\\fP.
.hy
Each deleted file has its own accompanied index file remembering
the original path, file size and deletion time.  If original file is
permanentsly deleted, so is the index file.
.TP
\fCrifiuti\fP
For Windows 95 to XP/2003, which uses a single index file named
\fCINFO2\fP (98 or above) or \fCINFO\fP (95 and NT4) under either
.nh
\fC\\RECYCLED\\\fP
.hy
(FAT 16/32) or
.nh
\fC\\RECYCLER\\\fP\fI<SID>\fP\fC\\\fP
.hy
(NTFS).
This file keeps track record for deletion status and info for \fIall\fP
deleted items, including those permanently removed or restored.

.PP
By default, both programs dump tab-delimited fields on
screen, which can be viewed on screen or imported into spreadsheet
program. \fB\-x\fP option instructs program to dump XML formatted
content instead.
.PP
\fBSince 0.7.0 version\fP, rifiuti2 output is in UTF-8 encoding only,
including the case of writing file under Windows.
.PP
Index field has different meaning for pre-Vista
and post-Vista versions.  INFO2 has an index number for each of
deletion item indicating the chronological order of items. For Vista
version, it means the index file name instead, which matches
pattern \(lq$I\fBxxxxxx\fP.\fI<ext>\fP\(rq, where \fBx\fP is random
alphanumeric character, and \fI<ext>\fP matches the extension of
original deleted item.
.PP
Deleted time is represented in UTC time by default. Under tab-delimited
mode, date/time is presented in format recognized by spreadsheet
programs, while in XML mode ISO 8601 date/time format is used.
For example, 3PM at 2014 X'mas represented in these modes would be
respectively:
.RS
\fC2014-12-25 15:00:00\fP
.br
\fC2014-12-25T15:00:00Z\fP
.RE
.PP
File size and file path are self-explanatory, but there are some
special issues to take care about.  Refer to \fBCAVEATS\fP section
below for more detail.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-o\fP, \fB\-\-output\fP=\fI\,FILE\/\fP
Write output to FILE.
.TP
\fB\-x\fP, \fB\-\-xml\fP
Output in XML format instead of tab\-delimited values.
With XML mode, all plain text options are disallowed,
and result is always in UTF-8 encoding.
See below for plain text options.
.TP
\fB\-l\fP, \fB\-\-legacy\-filename\fP=\fI\,CODEPAGE\/\fP
Show legacy filename if available (like \(lq\fCD:\\Progra~1\\\fP\(rq),
and specify the CODEPAGE used in the Windows system producing this
INFO2 file. Any encodings supported by \fBiconv\fP(1) can be used,
though for maximum accuracy of file name results, it is better to
stick with Microsoft codepages (such as CP850 or CP1252 for west
European version, CP932 for Japanese, etc).

.RS
\fBNote\fP: This option is mandatory if INFO2 file is created by
Windows 95, 98 or ME, since recycle bins under these OS don't contain
Unicode file name. This option does not exist in \fCrifiuti-vista\fP.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-z\fP, \fB\-\-localtime\fP
Present deletion time in numeric time zone of local system running
the program.  By default, UTC time is displayed, which is the time
value recorded in index files. Using the X'mas example above, the
time for Berlin (without daylight saving time) would be
\fC2014-12-25T16:00:00+0100\fP in ISO 8601 format.

.RS
\fBNote\fP: It is possible to use any timezone of users' choice
by setting \fC$TZ\fP environment variable, though not recommended.
See \fBENVIRONMENT VARIABLE\fP section below.
.RE

.SS
PLAIN TEXT OUTPUT OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-t\fP, \fB\-\-delimiter\fP=\fI\,STRING\/\fP
String to use as delimiter (TAB by default). Other than normal
characters, several escape sequences are also recognised:
.br
\fC\\r\fP (carriage return)
.br
\fC\\n\fP (line feed)
.br
\fC\\t\fP (tab)
.br
\fC\\e\fP (escape)
.TP
\fB\-n\fP, \fB\-\-no\-heading\fP
Don't show recycle bin path name, metadata and field headers
.TP
\fB\-8\fP, \fB\-\-always\-utf8\fP
(Option deprecated since 0.7.0 version)
.PP

.SS
MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-v\fP, \fB\-\-version\fP
Print version information and exit.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
Show help options and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\-all\fP
Show all help options and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\-text\fP
Show plain text output options and exit.
.PP

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
\fCrifiuti-vista \-x \-z \-o result.xml \\case\\S\-1\-2\-3\\\fP
.RS
Scan for index files under \\case\\S\-1\-2\-3\\, adjust all deletion
time for local time zone, and write XML output to result.xml
.RE
.TP
\fCrifiuti-vista \-n \\case\\S\-1\-2\-3\\\fP
Show tab-delimited result on screen without header and metadata
.TP
\fCrifiuti-vista -t '\\r\\n' \\case\\S\-1\-2\-3\\$IF96NJ3.rtf\fP
Only analyse a single index file and print each field in its own line
.TP
\fCrifiuti \-t ',' -o result.csv INFO2\fP
Change tab-delimited result to comma-delimited and write to result.csv
.TP
\fCrifiuti \-l CP1255 \-n INFO2\fP
.RS
Assuming INFO2 from Hebrew version of Windows, display 8.3 file names
without header and metadata
.RE

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables affect execution of program:

.TP
\fBLANG\fP / \fBLC_CTYPE\fP / \fBLC_ALL\fP
.RS
If recycle bin path contains non-ASCII character, these variables
affect how they are displayed. However it is not recommended
to modify them, as since 0.7.0 version rifiuti2 no more
expects any environment using non UTF-8 encoding.
.RE
.TP
\fBG_MESSAGES_DEBUG\fP
.RS
Setting \fCG_MESSAGES_DEBUG=rifiuti2\fP would cause programs to print
more debugging output to stderr.
.RE
.TP
\fBTZ\fP
.RS
If non-empty, indicate user-specified time zone when \fB\-z\fP option
is used. Normally the time zone information is obtained from system
and there is no need to set this variable. However, it can be used
as a facility to temporarily override timezone for some programs, which
can be used for situations like constructing timeline event.
.PP
This value is OS dependent. For example, for timezone in Los Angeles,
the value for Windows is \(lqPST8PDT\(rq, while corresponding value on
Linux would be \(lqAmerica/Los_Angeles\(rq. Please consult manual for
your operating system for more info.
.PP
Please see \fBCAVEATS\fP section below for problems when using this variable.
.RE

.SH EXIT STATUS
Both programs return 0 on success, and greater than 0 if error occurs.
.PP
In particular, \fCrifiuti-vista\fP would exit with the latest non-zero
status when error is encountered in \fIany\fP of the index files.

.TP
1
Wrong command line argument
.TP
2
Error when opening file or directory
.TP
3
Recycle bin data fails basic validation
.TP
4
Error when writing output to file
.TP
5
User supplied wrong encoding for legacy path

.SH HISTORY
.PP
\fIRifiuti2\fP is a rewrite of \fIrifiuti\fP, a tool of identical
purpose written by Foundstone which was later purchased by
McAfee. Quoting from the original FoundStone page:

.RS
Many computer crime investigations require the reconstruction of a
subject's Recycle Bin. Since this analysis technique is executed
regularly, we researched the structure of the data found in the
Recycle Bin repository files (INFO2 files). Rifiuti, the Italian word
meaning "trash", was developed to examine the contents of the INFO2
file in the Recycle Bin. ... Rifiuti is built to work on multiple
platforms and will execute on Windows (through Cygwin), Mac OS X,
Linux, and *BSD platforms.
.RE

.PP
However, since the original rifiuti (last updated 2004) can't analyze
recycle bin from any localized version of Windows (restricted to
English), this rewrite effort is born to overcome the limitation. Later
rifiuti2 was improved to add support for Vista format recycle bin, XML
output and other extra features not available from original version.

.SH CAVEATS
In very special circumstance (which author can't reproduce now),
index file of certain deleted item can be corrupt, causing incorrect
deleted file size to be stored. There is no way to report correct size.
This problem was only observed in Vista though, not any other versions
of Window.
.PP
Non-ASCII deleted item path name may not be always displayed
appropriately on console. Although great care is taken to
display path name as much as possible (resorting to escaped hex
.nh
\fC<\\XX>\fP
.hy
or escaped unicode
.nh
\fC<\\uXXXX>\fP
.hy
in case of invalid or invisible characters), the font used in console
might not be able to display all characters needed. Dumping result
into file and open with UTF-8 capable text editor is an option.
.PP
It is always better to use UTC time whenever possible, because
calculation of local time might not be correct, especially for non-US users.

has this statement:
.RS
The C run-time library assumes the United States' rules for implementing
the calculation of daylight saving time (DST).
.RE
Since the difference between standard time and DST is hardcoded to be
one hour (which is incorrect for a few selected regions), the file
deletion time might not be correct for these regions when DST is in
effect.
.PP
File size can mean the real size of deleted file, or the cluster size
it occupies on filesystem, depending on recycle bin format. As a rule
of thumb, if all sizes of entries are multiples of 512, it can be assumed
the concerned sizes refer to cluster size.
