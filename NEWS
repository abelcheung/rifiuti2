==== rifiuti2 0.6.0 ====
* Windows 10 recycle bin support
* Bug fix for Win98 INFO2 file support
* Behavior change:
  - Display file deletion time in UTC time zone by default
  - Vista version:
    * No more accepts multiple file arguments
    * Invalid file or dir in command argument treated as fatal error
  - INFO2 version:
    * No more accepts standard input as input data

==== rifiuti2 0.5.1 ====
* New manpage
* Test cases added to repository
* Debian packaging stuff added to repository

==== rifiuti2 0.5.0 ====
* Complete rewrite, using glib for I18N support and unicode handling
* This means INFO2 records from any localized version of Windows can
  be parsed correctly
* Since Vista recycle bin format changed completely, there will be no
  INFO2 file. A new program, rifiuti-vista, handles such format.
* Both program can output in XML format as well as tab-delimited
  plain text.
* Can choose to output long path name or legacy one (like "Progra~1")
* Some preliminary check to guard against specially crafted recycle
  bin files.
