= Installation =

Currently source code and Windows binary packages are available. People are welcome to package it under various kinds of Unix and Linux distribution and submit them here. Please refer to `README` file on how to compile and install it under Linux/Unix.

== Windows packages ==

Two flavours are available, one with glib and another without.

  * The one with glib is for Windows without any GTK+ library installed. It only contains the bare minimum libraries necessary to make rifiuti2 work, without any localization files.
  * The one without glib is for Windows having GTK+ library already installed. GTK+ for Windows has 2 variants:
    # from [http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/ GIMP for Windows official site]
    # from [http://gladewin32.sourceforge.net/ Glade for Windows project]
(actually there is a third one from [http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/downloads.html Tor Lillqvist], but that's very cumbersome to install, and not recommended for faint of heart)
