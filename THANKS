Obviously, all credits must go to Keith Jones and all the folks at
Foundstone. Without their analysis on Windows Recycle Bin it is much

But there are more people to say thanks:

Hilda Chan (Providing Chinese Vista Recycle Bin sample data)
Anthony Wong <ypwong@gmail.com> (Providing manpage & original Debian packaging)
